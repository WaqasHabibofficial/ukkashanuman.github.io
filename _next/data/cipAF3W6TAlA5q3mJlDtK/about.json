Before starting RAD, Michael’s professional career flourished, yet he was fundamentally unsatisfied. He recognized his work, while good, wasn’t realizing architecture’s potential to bring true value into people’s lives.<br /><br />In 2016, Michael met several individuals and companies that introduced him to the term “social impact” and “social enterprise”. This new network of people incorporated a “conscious capitalism” approach with their businesses to make an impact on social needs and restore lives. The idea that business can maximize profits while also maximizing benefits to society and the environment sparked a new passion.</p><p>Michael wondered, “Why can’t architects operate this way? We have the skillset to be a catalyst for good. People matter. Creative problem-solving through architecture and design can serve others.” From this point forward, he longed to leverage his training and skills for sustainable social good. In 2017, Michael launched RAD and has been striving toward its vision of building a better future ever since.  Michael graduated from the School of Architecture at Southern Polytechnic State University in 2004 and is a registered Architect with the State of Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, New Jersey and Wisconsin.</p>"},{"img":{"url":"https://images.prismic.io/rad-project/aIbsElGsbswqTUvp_headshotwebsite.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&rect=49%2C4%2C939%2C1409&w=1024&h=1536&q=100","src":{"desktop":"https://images.prismic.io/rad-project/aIbsElGsbswqTUvp_headshotwebsite.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&rect=49%2C4%2C939%2C1409&w=1024&h=1536&q=100","tablet":"","mobile":""},"alt":"","type":""},"title":"TAYLOR PINILLA AIA","subtitle":"<p>Project Manager</p>","bio":"<p>Taylor joined RAD in 2021, where she has played a key role in both designing and managing a variety of projects.

After that, Julian worked for two firms for another five years before landing at RAD. He is passionate about architecture, thrives for better design, and believes that architecture should be for all and not for those who can afford it. Julian believes architecture should go beyond economic boundaries and be accessible to all. Architecture is not merely about buildings but weaving narratives, uplifting communities, and enhancing the human experience. With each project, he hopes to create spaces that inspire, empower, and embrace the diversity of each community.

Or has he done everything? He is the architectural equivalent of Schrodinger’s cat. His favorite color is cornflower blue and he constantly naps at work. When he occasionally rouses from deep REM sleep, he has been known to answer emails in a perfectly executed haiku or not at all. He doesn’t believe in Santa or drink water or have a belly button. But he does always smell like fresh Gorgonzola shoved in a gym sock that’s been slowly heating on an exposed radiator all morning (Hunter’s preferred lunch). We love Marktavious of Zanzibar y tu mama tambien, despite the fact that he is not a person at all. Or is he the most human of us all? He currently resides somewhere in our technology as the copier/fax/server/etc. because the rent was too damn high. Due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we’re never actually sure where he is or how fast he is going. We feel pretty certain he’s wearing a tight black t-shirt, though.
